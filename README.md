# PocketAES Encryption and Decryption Utility

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the AES encryption and decryption algorithm for educational purposes. It provides the functionality to encrypt and decrypt text blocks, individual hexadecimal blocks, and text files. The project is organized into three main parts:

1. **D1**: Demonstrates AES operations on individual text blocks, including SubNibbles, ShiftRow, and MixColumns.
2. **D2**: Decrypts a single ciphertext block using a given key.
3. **D3**: Decrypts a text file encrypted using the AES algorithm.
